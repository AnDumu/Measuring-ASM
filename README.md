## Visual Studio 2022 C++

How to test it, in file **archivo.txt**

```ASM
[Incremetar EAX]
40					;inc eax
C3					;ret

[Incrementar ECX]
41					;inc ecx
C3					;ret
```

Between `[` you have a **description**, below the **opcodes** (machine code), don't forget to include the **C3** (ret) and you can also add **comments**.
